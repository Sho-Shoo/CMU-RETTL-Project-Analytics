    "In this notebook, we are going to take `detector_results.csv` and aggregate the data by `studentID`, `periodID`, and `dayID` to summarize each student's struggle, system misuse, gaming, and idleness status in each day/period. We are also going to summarize teacher's help offered to each student during each day/period, each student's help seeking pattern (raising hands) for each day/period from `observation_events.tsv`. Eventually we are going to put them together to see if these variables pertain any correlation. "
